## Project Description and Objectives
The primary goal and function of the Flight Analytics ETL pipeline  project is to extract monthly weather and airport flight cancellations data from a daily airport weather and daily flight information from an airlines database for those same dates. Once the extracted data is normalized, cleaned, processed, merged, and made useful to the data science team, the data is loaded back into a data warehouse that is readily available for data scientists to work with.
